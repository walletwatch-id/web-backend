This is the front-end app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load font.
